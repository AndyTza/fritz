# Usage

All operations are started via the `fritz` script.  Please type
`./fritz --help` to see available commands.

## Configuration

The `fritz.yaml` file contains settings for the marshal, including a
secret token (which must be customized before deployment), and
authentication tokens.

## Setting up the database

Before Fritz is launched for the first time, the database needs to be created:

```
./fritz run --init
```

## Launching Fritz

```
./fritz run
```
